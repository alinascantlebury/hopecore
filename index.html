    <p> i enjoy laughing and being optimistic. more people should laugh and be optimistic. my digital zine will explore the idea of hopecore—a practice of intentional optimism in an
        age where nihilism feels easier than joy. <a
            href="https://www.trendbible.com/trendterms/hopecore/">‘Hopecore’ (and the concept of ‘Finding
            Feeling’).</a> Like picking wild berries, an act that reconnects us to the earth and
        reminds us we're part of something larger, this project invites visitors to rediscover forgotten feelings and
        simple pleasures. In a time when college students and professors alike struggle with hopelessness, hopecore
        offers a counter-narrative: that laughter, optimism, and our connection to nature aren't naive, but necessary. a
        reminder that we can choose to find feeling, foster connection, and cultivate hope, even when the world suggests
        otherwise. this is my call to action: more people should laugh, more people should be optimistic, and more
        people should remember that we are one with the earth together. </p>
